# Tensorflow Face Recognition

## Pipeline
Image -> FaceDetection -> CroppedFace -> FaceRecognition -> Descriptor(128D) -> FaceClassifier -> Name

## FaceDetection(mobilenetSSD)
A mobilenet SSD(single shot multibox detector) based face detector with pretrained model provided.
Ref. [https://github.com/yeephycho/tensorflow-face-detection](https://github.com/yeephycho/tensorflow-face-detection)

## FaceRecognition(FaceNet)
TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper "FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering". 
Ref. [https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)

## FaceClassification(kNN, SVM)
Classify the features generated by FaceNet with kNN or SVM.
